# Progress

## Done
- Phase 1: Scaffold, config, fake broker, store, CI, .env.example
  - `pyproject.toml` with `[dev]` extra (pytest, pytest-asyncio, ruff)
  - `omega_ib/config.py`: pydantic-settings, TradingMode enum, live-trading gate
    (`live_trading_authorized` requires TRADING_MODE=live AND exact LIVE_CONFIRM phrase),
    `is_read_only`, `kill_switch_active`, hard risk limits with validators that
    reject `allow_naked_short_calls=True` / `allow_market_orders_options=True` outright.
  - `omega_ib/broker/base.py`: `BrokerBase` ABC + `Contract`/`OrderRequest`/`OrderStatus`/
    `Position`/`AccountSummary` dataclasses shared by fake and (future) IB broker.
  - `omega_ib/broker/fake.py`: in-memory `FakeBroker` — fills orders immediately at
    limit price (or settable mock price), tracks positions/cash/NAV/realized PnL.
  - `omega_ib/store/models.py`: SQLAlchemy models — Signal, Order, Fill, Trade,
    AIDecision, AuditLog, DailySnapshot.
  - `omega_ib/store/db.py`: engine/session factory (StaticPool for in-memory sqlite
    used by tests), `write_audit()` helper.
  - `.env.example` covering all settings.
  - Tests: `tests/test_config.py`, `tests/test_fake_broker.py`, `tests/test_store.py`.
  - `ruff check .` and `pytest -q` both green (11 passed).

- Phase 2: IB connection + reconnect + read-only snapshot
  - `omega_ib/broker/ib.py`: `IBBroker(BrokerBase)` wrapping `ib_async.IB` — connect/
    disconnect, `reconnect_with_backoff()` (exponential backoff), `heartbeat()`
    (via `reqCurrentTime`, never raises), `qualify_contract`, `place_order`,
    `cancel_order`/`cancel_all` (`reqGlobalCancel`), `positions()` (via `ib.portfolio()`),
    `account_summary()`, `open_orders()`. Registers `disconnectedEvent`/`errorEvent`
    handlers for logging.
  - Pure conversion helpers (`_to_ib_contract`, `_to_ib_order`, `_parse_account_summary`,
    `_portfolio_item_to_position`, `_trade_to_status`) built and unit-tested directly
    against in-process `ib_async` objects — no network needed.
  - `Contract` dataclass (broker/base.py) extended with `leg_action`/`leg_ratio` so BAG
    combo legs (needed by options_builder.py in phase 6) can be expressed.
  - `omega_ib/tools/check_connection.py`: read-only CLI smoke test (connect, print
    account summary + positions + open orders, disconnect). Never places orders.
  - Tests: `tests/test_ib_broker.py` (contract/order/account/position/status conversion),
    `tests/test_ib_broker_reconnect.py` (reconnect backoff + heartbeat via mocked `IB`).
  - `ruff check .` and `pytest -q` both green (25 passed).

## In progress
- (none)

## Blocked
- No IB Gateway reachable in this dev/CI sandbox. `check_connection.py` and the real
  `IBBroker.connect()` path are untested end-to-end here; the pure logic (contract/order
  building, account/position parsing, reconnect/heartbeat control flow) is fully unit
  tested with mocks. True live-integration check against a running IB Gateway paper
  account is pending until run on the VM.

## Next
- Phase 3: `risk/guard.py` (pre-trade checks, sizing, exposure, PDT, kill switch),
  grep-based test enforcing only guard calls `broker.place_order`.
